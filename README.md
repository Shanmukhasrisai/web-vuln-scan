# web-vuln-scan

A simple web vulnerability scanner written in Go, similar to Nuclei.

## Overview

web-vuln-scan is a lightweight vulnerability scanning tool for web applications. It loads vulnerability templates from JSON files and performs HTTP-based security assessments on specified targets.

## Features

- **Template-Based Scanning**: Load custom vulnerability signatures from JSON files
- **Concurrent Scanning**: Multi-threaded scanning with configurable concurrency levels
- **Flexible Targeting**: Scan multiple URLs with support for target files
- **JSON Results**: Export scan results to JSON format for integration with other tools
- **Status & Content Matching**: Match vulnerabilities based on HTTP status codes and response content
- **TLS Support**: Works with HTTPS endpoints (with InsecureSkipVerify option)

## Installation

### From Source (Linux/macOS/Cloud Shell)

```bash
go install github.com/Shanmukhasrisai/web-vuln-scan@latest
```

Or clone and build:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shanmukhasrisai/web-vuln-scan.git
cd web-vuln-scan
go build -o web-vuln-scan main.go
```

### Requirements

- Go 1.16 or higher
- Linux, macOS, or any Unix-like environment (including Google Cloud Shell)

## Usage

### Basic Scan

```bash
web-vuln-scan -targets targets.txt -templates templates.json -output results.json
```

### Command-Line Options

```
-targets string
  File containing target URLs (one per line) [REQUIRED]
  
-templates string
  JSON file containing vulnerability templates (default: "templates.json")
  
-concurrency int
  Number of concurrent scans (default: 10)
  
-timeout int
  HTTP timeout in seconds (default: 10)

```

### Example

1. Create `targets.txt`:
   ```
   http://example.com
   https://example.org
   ```

2. Create `templates.json`:
   ```json
   [
     {
       "id": "test-vuln-1",

## Reporting Modes

web-vuln-scan generates three report types from the same scan data to match different audiences.

- **Developer report**  
  - Full technical details, HTTP request/response evidence and payloads.  
  - Affected parameters, CVE/CWE/OWASP mappings and code-level remediation guidance.

- **Customer / management report**  
  - Executive summary, risk heatmap and vulnerability counts by severity.  
  - OWASP Top 10 and compliance mapping (PCI, ISO 27001, NIST), plus business impact and high-level remediation plan.

- **Researcher report**  
  - Focus on exploit chains, PoCs and attack paths.  
  - CVSS scoring, references (NVD/MITRE/advisories) and bug-bounty friendly narrative.

Each report type can be exported as:

- HTML (interactive, web dashboard)  
- PDF (client-ready)  
- DOCX / Markdown (for further editing or ISO audit packs)

Example:

```bash
web-vuln-scan report --scan-id 1234 \
  --mode developer \
  --format pdf \
  --output reports/dev-report-1234.pdf
```


## Web Dashboard

The built-in WebVAPT dashboard runs on localhost and can be accessed both from a Linux VM and the host machine.

- Start the server:

```bash
web-vuln-scan server --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
# or via Docker / Kubernetes as shown below
```

- Access from:
  - VM browser: `http://127.0.0.1:8080`
  - Host browser: `http://<vm-local-ip>:8080`

From the dashboard you can:

- Add targets (single URL, list file or asset group).
- Choose scan mode: Quick / Light / Aggressive.  
- Choose report type: Developer / Customer / Researcher.  
- Export reports as HTML, PDF or DOCX with OWASP/CWE/compliance mapping.

## Core Architecture

### Scanning Engine
- **Goroutine-Based Concurrency**: Parallel processing across multiple targets and payloads
- **Adaptive Threading**: Dynamic worker allocation based on system resources
- **Rate Limiting**: Configurable per-target, per-host, and global rate limits
- **Timeout Management**: Intelligent timeout handling with exponential backoff

### Detection Framework
- **Template System**: YAML-based vulnerability signatures with variable support
- **Matchers**: Status codes, regex patterns, word matches, JSON/XML extraction
- **Extractors**: Dynamic variable extraction for multi-stage attack chains
- **Conditional Logic**: Complex AND/OR matching conditions

## Scan Modes

web-vuln-scan supports three predefined scan profiles that can be run from CLI or via the WebVAPT dashboard.

- **Quick**: Fast health-check style scan with limited templates and low resource usage. Targets core OWASP Top 10 checks and basic misconfigurations only.
- **Light**: Safe production-friendly profile focusing on OWASP Top 10 and common web vulns with non-destructive payloads. Suitable for continuous scanning on live environments.
- **Aggressive**: Full template set with heavy payloads, fuzzing and deeper coverage. May trigger WAFs, rate limits or app-side issues and should be used only in approved test environments.

Select the profile:

```bash
web-vuln-scan scan -u https://target.tld --profile quick
web-vuln-scan scan -u https://target.tld --profile light
web-vuln-scan scan -u https://target.tld --profile aggressive
```

## Configuration Profiles

### Aggressive Scanning
```yaml
profile: aggressive
threads: 100
timeout: 30s
retries: 3
rate_limit: 1000/s
```

### Stealth Mode
```yaml
profile: stealth
threads: 5
timeout: 60s
retries: 1
rate_limit: 10/s
random_agent: true
```

### Production Assessment
```yaml
profile: production
threads: 25
timeout: 45s
retries: 2
rate_limit: 100/s
safe_mode: true
```
